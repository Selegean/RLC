# RLC_Functie: RLC Circuit Analysis
This project features a MATLAB function for analyzing and visualizing the behavior of a parallel RLC (Resistor, Inductor, Capacitor) circuit.

## Features
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Modify resistance, inductance, capacitance, voltage, and frequency via a graphical user interface.
- **Total Current & Admittance vs. Frequency**: Displays how the total current and circuit admittance vary with frequency.
- **Inductive & Capacitive Susceptance vs. Frequency**: Shows the susceptance of the inductor and capacitor as functions of frequency.
- **Currents Through R, L, and C**: Provides a time-domain plot of currents through the resistor, inductor, and capacitor, including the total current.
- **Voltage Across R, L, and C**: Visualizes voltage across each component over time.
